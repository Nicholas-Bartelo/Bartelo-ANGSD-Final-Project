# Bartelo-ANGSD-Final-Project

## Folder Descriptions

### BLAST Search and Results

Contains three files explaining why we used BLAST for the overrepresented sequences of diabetes sample 3 and the results.

### Bash Scripts

Contains all bash scripts used in the project. This includes a script for genome indexing, alignment of reads, qoRTs file generation, and featureCounts.

### Code For QoRTs and Feature Counts File Creation in SCU

Contains instructions and reasons for parameters used for the code for QoRTs and featureCounts.

### Downloading Reads to SCU, Genome Generation, Alignment of Reads, and BamQC

Contains instructions and reasons for parameters used for the download of the fastq files from GEO, genome indexing, alignment of reads, and bamQC.

### FeatureCounts Analysis and DE Analysis

Contains all analyses using the counts we generated using our pipeline and also the counts downloaded from the publication.

### FeatureCounts Files For Final Writeup

Contains the output from featureCounts from our pipeline and the publication.

### Figures For Final Writeup

Contains all figures from the final writeup. These figures can be used to populate the RMD exactly as it looks in the HTML by opening the RMD and copying the figures to an RStudio session. 

### IGV Screenshot

Contains the screenshot from IGV showing that we have stranded reads.

### bamqc files

Contains all bamQC files used to show potential problems with the aligned files.

### fastqc summary files

Contains all fastqc files for each sample which can be used to look at the overrepresented sequences for each sample, as well as other properties of the raw reads.

### multiqc result

Contains the culmination of all sample fastqc reports for easy comparison of the samples.

### qoRTs Files Generated

Contains all qoRTs pdf files output after running the tool. Used for additional QC and to show that all mice are female.
